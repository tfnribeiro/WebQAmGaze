    <p class=""webgaze-experiment-compact"" id=""paragraph"">The International Union for Conservation of Nature is <span id=""meco_para_11_qa_0"">an international organization</span> working in the field of nature conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources.

Its mission is to 'influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the <span id=""meco_para_11_qa_2"">world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable'</span>. Over the past decades, the organization has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its projects.

Instead, the organization tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for <span id=""meco_para_11_qa_3"">compiling and publishing the Red List of Threatened Species</span>, which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide.
